# fictional-tools_as_HackerTypers
A Collection of basic HackerTypers (using the version 2 format) what have been made into specific fictional tools.

These are a set of HackerTypers that have been created using the basic template found in Version 2.
(See:- https://github.com/GandalfsLair/LRPHackerTyper_V2)

In this instance I have given them names and assigned functionality that I thought might be useful. 
If new tooling is created using the generic HackerTyper code I will endeavor to add them here.
